            <h2>Data Analyst Intern</h2>
            <p><strong>Company:</strong> BRIDGES (Palisades Mall, West Nyack, NY)</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> September 2024 - December 2024</p>
            <p>As a Data Analyst Intern at BRIDGES, I was responsible for developing a secure WordPress-based webpage that granted restricted access to vital documents for employees. This project included implementing stringent security measures to protect document access and usability. I also translated key program documents into Spanish, enhancing accessibility for Spanish-speaking staff members. A large part of my role involved analyzing employee usage data to optimize document accessibility and refine website functionality.</p>
            <p>My work was highly collaborative, as I partnered with different departments to ensure accurate data representation and a smooth implementation of the document access system. This internship allowed me to apply my technical and problem-solving skills to support organizational goals while enhancing the site's security and functionality.</p>

            <h2>Undergraduate Data Science Research Intern</h2>
            <p><strong>Company:</strong> The Data Mine (Purdue University)</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> August 2023 – April 2024</p>
            <p>As a Data Science Research Intern with Purdue University's The Data Mine, I engaged in predictive modeling and machine learning projects focused on healthcare applications. I participated in the ATOM - Small Molecule Data Driven Modelling for Drug Discovery project, developing models to predict hERG (heart toxicity) data using single-task and multi-task modeling techniques. Working with various assay datasets, I explored advanced machine learning methodologies, including supervised/unsupervised learning, classification, and regression models.</p>
            <p>This experience required tools such as Python, DeepChem, and SQL, offering hands-on exposure to predictive modeling applications across fields like healthcare, advertising, and energy. My work here deepened my understanding of machine learning workflows, from data collection and model training to evaluation, and equipped me with skills crucial for data science in real-world contexts.</p>
