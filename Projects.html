            <h2>Personal Profile Webpage Project (Senior Portfolio)</h2>
            <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> August 2024 – February 2025</p>  
            <p>I developed a personal portfolio webpage that highlights my projects, internships, and technical expertise. This project was a central component of my senior portfolio, crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an engaging, interactive site. Key features included dark/light mode functionality, an admin login system that restricted file upload and deletion to only me, file upload previews with titles and descriptions, and a custom loading animation to provide smooth page transitions.</p>
            <p>I also incorporated a 404 "Not Found" page to handle navigation errors gracefully, preserving the site's visual theme. While the initial version of this project included Firebase for file storage, I was unable to find an API that allowed me to store files in a way that suited my needs. As a result, the finalized and published version of the webpage functioned entirely on local storage. This meant that while all features, including file uploads and admin access, worked seamlessly, the uploaded content was only visible to me. Despite this limitation, the project successfully demonstrated my ability to build an interactive and visually engaging portfolio.</p>

            <h2>Linktree for a Friend</h2>

            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> January 2025 – February 2025</p>
            <p>I developed a simple yet functional Linktree-style webpage for a friend, designed to serve as a centralized hub for their most important web links. This project was built using only HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean and responsive design to ensure easy navigation across different devices. The webpage featured custom-styled buttons that directed users to my friend’s various webpages, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.</p>
            <p>The Linktree webpage was designed with minimalism and efficiency in mind, ensuring that it loaded quickly and functioned smoothly without relying on JavaScript or external frameworks. I carefully structured the layout to be fully responsive, allowing seamless interaction on both desktop and mobile devices. The final result was a polished, easy-to-use webpage that effectively organized and presented my friend’s online presence.</p>
